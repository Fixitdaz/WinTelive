# WinTelive
telive compatible frontend for Windows
(similar to my other projects - this was abandoned once it was working
enough for community to take over and fork/patch. i got out of the SDR
scene so i don't have the motivation to maintain this)


Still pretty much work in progress but more or less working Windows port of telive.
You just feed it data from tetra-rx and connect it to running GNURadio companion
project. Currently only working the the XMLRPC version of the projects, completely
passive mode to come later.
