# WinTelive
telive comaptible frontend for Windows

Still pretty much work in progress but more or less working Windows port of telive.
You just feed it data from tetra-rx and connect it to running GNURadio companion
project. Currently only working the the XMLRPC version of the projects, completely
passive mode to come later.
